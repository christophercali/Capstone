          <p>The future of vehicular travel is rapidly moving towards electric-powered vehicles, thanks to a surge of
            interest and investment in sustainable transportation. The US government is actively supporting this
            transition through various incentives and regulations with the recent passing of the Bipartisan
            Infrastructure Bill and Inflation Reduction Act. A <a
              href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-standards-and-major-progress-for-a-made-in-america-national-network-of-electric-vehicle-chargers/"
              target="blank">recent press release by the Biden-Harris administration</a> sets a goal of making EVs
            (electric vehicles) account for at least 50% of new car sales by 2030.

          <p><strong>For the transition to fully electric vehicles to be successful, it is essential that the charging
              infrastructure supports the rollout by being widespread and easily accessible. New York City encounters
              unique challenges to improving and increasing Electric Vehicle Charging infrastructure due to its densely
              packed population.</strong></p>

          <h3>This Capstone project seeks to evaluate where NYC stands in its efforts to establish accessible and
            widespread
            Electric Vehicle charging infrastructure.</h3>

      <p>In New York City, the focus of this project, the local government is taking steps to increase the
        uptake of EVs. The City's Department of Transportation (DOT), Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC), and Department
        of Citywide Administrative Services, along with private companies, are working towards an all-electric future.
        See what they are working on below.</p>

      <div class="container-fluid">



        <!-- Mayor Eric Adams and the City's Taxi & Limousine Commission<a
              href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/790-23/mayor-adams-tlc-commissioner-do-deliver-green-rides-program-make-all-nyc-shared-rides#/0"
              target="blank">recently announced that Uber and Lyft will be required to
              be zero-emission by 2030</a>, affecting an estimated 100,000 for-hire vehicles. Both Uber and Lyft are in
            support of this initiative and aim to have an all-electric fleet by 2030. The city's Department of

          <h3>Takeaways and Further Questions</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="effortsContainer">
          <div class="effortsCard">
            <h2>Outer Boroughs</h2>
            <p>Into the outer boroughs, there are fewer options for public charging available. These areas make it
              difficult for those interested in switching to an EV.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effortsCard">
            <h2>Income</h2>
            <p>As expected, higher income areas have more charging infrastructure. EVs are still not very affordable.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effortsCard">
            <h2>Racial Disparity</h2>
            <p>Areas with a high percentage of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) individuals do not have EV
              charging locations. What can the City do to increase equity on this front?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effortsCard">
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>The map for education and income do not look very different, likely because there is a high correlation
              between the two.</p>
          </div>
        </div> -->

        <!-- <div id="dataP" class="textbox">
        <p>To better understand the EV charging landscape in NYC, I bring together <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest" target="blank">Department of Energy Data</a> on publicly available EV charging stations (as of 4.20.23) and <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/planning-level/nyc-population/american-community-survey.page" target="blank">American Community Survey</a> data (5-Year: Estimate of Median Household Income, Race Breakdown, and Education Level). With this information, we can identify areas that are underserved by EV charging infrastructure and make potential recommendations for equitable development.</p>

                      target="blank">announced</a> the Green Rides Initiative, which will require that all High-Volume
                    For-Hire Vehicles (Uber & Lyft) be zero-emission or wheelchair accessible by 2030. This will impact
                    an estimated 100,000 heavily used for-hire vehicles. Uber and Lyft are both in support of this
                    initiative.</p>
                  <p>TLC has phased the benchmarks for a "smooth and efficient transition to a cleaner, more accessible
                    fleet." Beginning in 2024, five percent of all high-volume (Uber & Lyft) trips will need to be
                    through vehicles that are either zero-emission or wheelchair accessible. The benchmark will then
                    rise to 15% in 2025 and 25% in 2026. In 2027 it will increase to 40%, then rise yearly by 20
                    percentage points until the end of the decade, when 100 percent of all rides will be under the
                    guidelines.</p>
                  <p>The initiative includes wheelchair accessible vehicles because manufacturers have not yet created
                    zero-emission/electric wheelchair accessible cars. It is possible this will change over the next few
                    years as the initiative rolls out and newer technology comes to market.</p>
