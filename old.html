        <ul>It's important to note that there are <a
                href="https://www.transportation.gov/rural/ev/toolkit/ev-basics/charging-speeds" target="blank">three
                different types of EV charging stations</a>:
            <li><strong>Level 1 Chargers:</strong> Through a common residential 120V AC outlet, takes over 24 hours to
                provide a full charge for an electric vehicle.</li>
            <li><strong>Level 2 Chargers:</strong>Higher-rate AC charging through 240V (in residential applications) or
                208V (in commercial applications) electrical service, common for home, workplace, and public charging.
                4-10+ hours for full charge.</li>
            <li><strong>DC Fast Chargers:</strong>Direct current fast charging (DCFC) equipment offers rapid charging
                and can get an EV charged up in 20 minutes to 1+ hour.</li>
            <p><strong>For this analysis, we will focus on Level 2 and DC Fast Chargers due to the inefficiency of Level
                    1 chargers.</strong></p>

          <h3>Takeaways and Further Questions</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="effortsContainer">
          <div class="effortsCard">
            <h2>Outer Boroughs</h2>
            <p>Into the outer boroughs, there are fewer options for public charging available. These areas make it
              difficult for those interested in switching to an EV.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effortsCard">
            <h2>Income</h2>
            <p>As expected, higher income areas have more charging infrastructure. EVs are still not very affordable.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effortsCard">
            <h2>Racial Disparity</h2>
            <p>Areas with a high percentage of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) individuals do not have EV
              charging locations. What can the City do to increase equity on this front?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="effortsCard">
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>The map for education and income do not look very different, likely because there is a high correlation
              between the two.</p>

        <p>To better understand the EV charging landscape in NYC, I bring together <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest" target="blank">Department of Energy Data</a> on publicly available EV charging stations (as of 4.20.23) and <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/planning-level/nyc-population/american-community-survey.page" target="blank">American Community Survey</a> data (5-Year: Estimate of Median Household Income, Race Breakdown, and Education Level). With this information, we can identify areas that are underserved by EV charging infrastructure and make potential recommendations for equitable development.</p>
